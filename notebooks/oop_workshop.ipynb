    "# Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP in Python heavily relies on the concept of class. You can think of a class as a blueprint that is used to create objects. To illustrate this, imagine that you have a blueprint for a speaker. You can use this blueprint to build multiple speakers. Each speaker that is created using the blueprint is an instance of the blueprint. Also, each created speaker has its attributes such as color, model, and name. They will also have their methods showing a certain kind of behavior such as volume up and volume down.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main goals of OOP is cleaner code.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand. â€“ Martin Fowler\n",
    "\n",
    "In their most basic form, classes are containers defined in code. They hold data and code together in one place. This means the data and the code that works with that data can be passed around and used together (encapsulation). Most complex objects in Python are classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplist class can be used to define an object like a point on a graph. Also note that in Python, class names are always writting in camel case (FirstLetterCapitalized).\n"
